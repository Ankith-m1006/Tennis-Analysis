Tennis Analysis
This repository contains a Python project for analyzing tennis gameplay using video input. The project utilizes object detection techniques and tracking algorithms to provide insights into tennis matches.

Features
Court Line Detection: Identifies the court lines from the video input.
Player Tracking: Tracks player movements across the court.
YOLO Inference: Uses YOLO for detecting objects in the video.
Video Input/Output: Processes input videos and generates output with analysis overlays.
