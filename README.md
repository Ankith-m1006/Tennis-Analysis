## Overview

The **Tennis Analysis** project is built using Python, with OpenCV for video processing, YOLO for object detection, and custom tracking algorithms for player movements. It processes tennis match videos to detect court lines, track players, and overlay analytical data onto the video.

## Features

- **Court Line Detection**: Accurately detects the tennis court lines.
- **Player Tracking**: Tracks player movements during the match.
- **YOLO Inference**: Uses YOLO for real-time object detection in videos.
- **Video Processing**: Analyzes input videos and generates output videos with analysis overlays.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tennis-analysis.git
    cd tennis-analysis
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

5. **Analyze Videos**: Place your videos in the `input_videos/` directory and retrieve analyzed videos from the `output_videos/` directory.

## Usage

- **Input Videos**: Place video files in the `input_videos/` directory.
- **Run Analysis**: Execute the main script to process the videos.
- **Output Videos**: The analyzed videos will be saved in the `output_videos/` directory.
