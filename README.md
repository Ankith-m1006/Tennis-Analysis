#Overview
The Tennis Analysis project is built using Python, with OpenCV for video processing, YOLO for object detection, and custom tracking algorithms for player movements. It processes tennis match videos to detect court lines, track players, and overlay analytical data onto the video.

#Features
#CourtLineDetection: Accurately detects the tennis court lines.
#PlayerTracking: Tracks player movements during the match.
#YOLOInference: Uses YOLO for real-time object detection in videos.
#VideoProcessing: Analyzes input videos and generates output videos with analysis overlays.
#Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tennis-analysis.git
cd tennis-analysis
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Analyze Videos: Place your videos in the input_videos/ directory and retrieve analyzed videos from the output_videos/ directory.

#Usage
Input Videos: Place video files in the input_videos/ directory.
Run Analysis: Execute the main script to process the videos.
Output Videos: The analyzed videos will be saved in the output_videos/ directory.
