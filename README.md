Overview
The Tennis Analysis project is built using Python and various computer vision libraries, including OpenCV and YOLO. It analyzes video footage to detect court lines, track player movements, and provide analytical feedback. The project is structured to be modular, allowing for easy adjustments and expansions.

Features
Court Line Detection: Accurately identifies the lines on a tennis court.
Player Tracking: Monitors and tracks player movements during the match.
YOLO Inference: Utilizes YOLO for real-time object detection within the video.
Video Processing: Takes input videos, analyzes them, and produces output videos with overlays that visualize the analysis.
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tennis-analysis.git
cd tennis-analysis
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Usage
Input Videos: Place your video files in the input_videos/ directory.
Run the Analysis: Execute the main script to process the videos and save the output with overlays in the output_videos/ directory.
Training Models: Use the scripts in the training/ directory to fine-tune or retrain models.
